nodecg-strawpoll
=================

This <a href="https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg">NodeCG</a> bundle shows poll results from a <a href="http://strawpoll.me">StrawPoll</a> poll.

You may want to edit `view/strawpoll.css`, I have marked the location of the bar colors, so you can change them.

The panel on the dashboard allows you to set:  
* The StrawPoll ID - the ID is the number from the URL, as in `http://strawpoll.me/<id>/r`  
* Display Mode. 1v1 will only display the first two answers, multiple will show all of them (in alphabetical order)
